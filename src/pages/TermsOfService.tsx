                Customer Responsibilities
              </h2>
              <p>
                A company, organization, individual or other qualified third
                party we refer to in these Terms are considered the “Customer”.
                It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to comply with
                Instagram rules and any legislation that they are subject to.
                The Customer uses SproutySocial at their own risk. SproutySocial
                is not responsible for your actions and their consequences. We
                are not to blame if your Instagram account is banned for any
                reason. To provide the Service we require the Customer Instagram
                username and password to obtain required information for the API
                of the relevant social media platform. We don’t store, give
                away, or otherwise distribute the password to any third parties.
                We will not post or comment on any accounts on the Customer
                account’s behalf. We do not make any claims as to the ownership
                of these accounts to which we have been given access. It is the
                Customer’s responsibility to ensure that their profile is
                connected to the service as long as the subscription is active.
                By purchasing our service you agree that you clearly understand
                and agree what you are purchasing and will not file a fraudulent
                dispute via your bank or the payment processor used.
              </p>

                Service Responsibilities
              </h2>
              <p>
                The service offers focus on bringing the attention of real users
                to your Instagram profile with goals that may include increasing
                followers, likes, and comments. The expected amount of
                followers, likes, and comments is not guaranteed to you in any
                way. Regardless of any perceived representation to the contrary,
                SproutySocial in no way guarantees a specific result for
                Customers. You understand that you are paying us for our effort
                to generate results, but that results are never guaranteed as
                there are many factors involved, some of which are out of our
                control. Moreover, we cannot protect you from spam, fake, or
                inactive followers, as it is not always possible to avoid them.
                It is understood that SproutySocial has no control over
                Instagram and if they decide to make changes to their platform.
                We can’t guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted, or error-free
                operability of the services. SproutySocial agrees to extend your
                current billing month for any unexpected delays or downtime
                caused by technical issues on our side within reasonable limits,
                as determined by our team.

                Notable Rules
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Services provided by SproutySocial require for the Customer
                to follow the Rules specified below as well as comply to the
                Privacy Policy described. By agreeing to these Terms of Service,
                you represent that you are at least 18 years old. Services we
                provide are strictly unavailable to children under the age of

                information without a consenting parent/guardian, please contact
                us immediately. You may not use our products for any illegal or
                unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Service,
                violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited
                to copyright laws). You must not transmit any worms or viruses
                or any code of a destructive nature. A breach or violation of
                any of the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your
                Services.

                Refunds (If applicable)
              </h2>
              <p>
                Yearly Plans are offered at a significant discount, and as such,
                are non-refundable. We understand that a lot can change on
                social media in a year, which is why we can offer to move your
                subscription to any other account of your choosing. Yearly plans
                that come with a growth Guarantee will have their billing dates
                extended to ensure that the client is only paying for results.
                That means that we may postpone your billing date to ensure that
                you reach your yearly goals without incurring any additional
                charges or renewals.
              </p>

                Plans with Action Guarantees
              </h2>
              <p>
                Social media is dynamic, and even our expert account managers
                can’t create followers out of thin air. If there is ever any
                drop in your progress and we do not get you the guaranteed
                amount of actions (measured via monthly reports) through our
                service, we will extend your current subscription month to
                ensure you are not billed until we get you the results you paid
                for. The extension will be done by postponing your next billing
                cycle.

                Refunds When Loss Access to Service
              </h2>
              <p>
                If your refund is approved and within the terms of our policy
                then your refund will be processed, and a credit will
                automatically be applied to your credit card or original method
                of payment within 3-10 business days. Refunds for any
                subscription type due to loss of access to a service related to
                Instagram will be honored at the sole discretion of the Company.
                This may include loss of access to an account and loss of access
                to features within a social media app, for example, features
                related to Instagram Reels.

                Refunds When Account is Paused or Disconnected
              </h2>
              <p>
                Pausing an account does not cancel the subscription and related
                charges. It does not pause the subscription itself, meaning it
                does not affect time until the subscription is renewed or the
                billing date. We don’t currently credit additional days for
                paused days. If you believe you should be credited with days for
                a paused account please contact Support. It is the sole
                responsibility of the Customer to provide updated passwords to
                SproutySocial during their use of the SproutySocial service. Any
                downtime of service in relation to a client not providing their
                current password will not result in any payment reimbursement
                for that period of time.

                Refund requests based on performance issues are reviewed on a
                case-by-case basis. Requests may include but are not limited to
                slow growth or irrelevant quality of followers and/or likes.
                While the Company strives to render Services as best as
                possible, the Company is under no obligation to fulfill requests
                of refunds.

              <p>
                Our growth system works within the limits set by Instagram for
                every specific account, which are affected by a variety of
                factors, including your Instagram account history, Trust Score,
                and overall posting and browsing habits. As such, it is
                impossible to guarantee a minimum interaction uptime for every
                specific account. While the Company cannot issue a refund for
                something outside of our control, we want to make sure every
                client has an excellent user experience. In case of downtime, we
                will be happy to extend your subscription or issue promotional
                credits. Please contact us if you have any issues with your
                subscription.
